My First HTTP Node.js Server
This is my first GitHub project, which demonstrates how to create a simple HTTP server using Node.js.

Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, you must have the following installed:

Node.js (version 10 or later)

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/konhito/FIRSTHTTPSERVERNODE

Change directory to the project folder using cd your-repository
Install dependencies by running npm install
Run the server using index.js

This project is all about a farm vegetables where farmers can add there fresh vegetables with the listing of organic or not.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/
You should see a landing page named node farm displayed in your browser. This is coming from the server you just started.
index.js
The index.js file is the main file of this project. It contains the code for creating an HTTP server using the Node.js http module.

The http.createServer() method creates an HTTP server object, and the .listen() method binds it to a specific port (in this case, port 8080). When a client sends an HTTP request to this server, the server responds with a message saying "Hello, world!".
